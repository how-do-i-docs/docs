# How to Set Up a Development Environment

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up a development environment for *How Do I Docs*. 

## Get the Site Source

1. Fork the [site repository](https://github.com/how-do-i-docs/site)

2. Open up a terminal and navigate to where you'd like the site source to be

3. Clone the forked repository with `git clone git@github.com/<your_username>/site.git`

## Download and Configure a Code Editor

1. As the site is plain old HTML and CSS, it can be edited with pretty much anything. For the best experience, though, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
