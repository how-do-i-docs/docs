# Project Overview

*How Do I Docs* is a website that provides a one-stop shop for people who are quickly building ideas in a time-constrained manner, like hackathon participants, to learn a little more about why they should have documentation, as well as providing clear easy-to-follow instructions on spinning up a documentation site of their own, with templates trimmed down for this specific use case.

## Why follow *How Do I Docs*?

Most resources available regarding open-source documentation currently focus on those who are creating projects that they plan to turn into decently-sized collaborative open-source communities. These need quite a lot of documentation. However, for the purposes of a hackathon project, one can get away with far less documentation, and those who are trying to figure out project documentation quickly may not have the patience to sort through long lists of templates, or compare the features of various documentation site generators and themes for them. **By stripping things down to the bare minimum, *How Do I Docs* attempts to reduce the barrier for people to lay groundwork for documenting their projects**, meaning they are well-positioned to continue adding documentation as their project grows further after the hackathon.

## How *How Do I Docs* Is Built

*How Do I Docs* is a relatively simple HTML/CSS website, styled with my own (heavily modified) version of the [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) library. This documentation site, as well as the documentation site template, is based on the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll template.
