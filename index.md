*How Do I Docs* is a site that serves as a one-stop shop for hackathon participants to learn what they need to know about documentation.

Too often, hackathon projects are left entirely undocumented, meaning that they can't be easily iterated on after the fact, and good projects don't get the appreciation they would otherwise warrant. While a full suite of documentation, like one would find in a large open-source project, is helpful, it's unrealistic in a "move-fast-break-things" setting like a hackathon. **As such, I wanted to curate a resource that not only encourages hackathon participants to document their projects, but provides a slimmed down subset of templates and concepts as well as a simple starting point to make adding a docs website to a project easy**.

This documentation site serves 3 purposes! First and foremost, it's my project's documentation, and has all the essential details. However, it also serves as a simple example of what the end result of the tutorial outlined on the site could look like. Finally, it serves as me dogfooding my own instructions, and making sure they work.
